Gamusa (Gamosa) is the identity of Assamese culture which is also known as &#8216;**Bihuwaan**&#8216;. Gamusa consists of two words &#8216;Ga&#8217; means &#8216;body&#8217; and &#8216;mosa&#8217; refers to &#8216;wipe&#8217; which makes Gamosa an ordinary towel. Although Gamusa is a small piece of cloth,  it means a lot for Assamese people. It is an irreplaceable asset for Assam. Simply Gamusa is a pride of Assam which holds all of us together from Muslim to Hindu, Brahmin to Ahom. It is an integral part of Assamese festival &#8216;Bihu&#8217; and it is used for religious and auspicious occasions as well.  There are three types of Gamosa such as **Paani Gamosa, Tamul Gamosa, and Bihuwan**. Apart from these three Gamusa, you can find another Gamusa in lower Assam which is known as **&#8216;Anakata&#8217;**. The specialty of this Gamusa is it is taken out from the &#8216;tatxal&#8217; without cutting. Unlike <a href="http://couplesky.com/index.php/2018/01/30/assamese-traditional-jewellery/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assamese Jewellery</a>, Gamusa is an integral part of Assamese tradition.

It is pretty much difficult to find out the history of Gamusa because nowhere is mentioned about its origin. According to Dr. Lila Goigoi, Gamosa has been used since the Ahom Kingdom. So, we can say that Gamusa is a great innovation of Assamese weaver.
