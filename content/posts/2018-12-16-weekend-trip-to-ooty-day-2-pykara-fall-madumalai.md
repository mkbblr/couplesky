<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Here is the story of the second day in Ooty. Actually, we planned to go to Coonoor by toy train on the second day. But the plan has not been successful. There are 60 seats in Toy train. 30 seats of these need to be booked online and 30 seats can be booked offline. But we did not get any option to book toy train. So we have changed the plan and researched over the internet about <a href="http://couplesky.com/weekend-trip-to-ooty-day-1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ooty trip</a> package. And found some Ooty packages for sightseeing which have been provided by some hotels. You can book the package <a href="http://economyhotelsinooty.com/Charges.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online</a> as well as offline. They provide a minibus which has a capacity of 20 people.  And even it is far cheaper than a private rented car.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So we started our journey to Pykara fall by the minibus along with 18 others at around 9.45am. They charged Rs 275 per person which did not include entrance tickets, guide fee, and parking fee. So we had to pay an extra Rs 40 per person. First, we visited the Rose garden which is situated 1 km away from the main bus stand of Ooty. The entry fee of Rosegarden Rs30 per adult. We spent 45mins in the rose garden and came back to the bus. Actually, that travel guide fixes a time how long we will spend in a particular place. After Rose garden the has started the journey towards Pykara fall.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Pykara fall is located 16 km distance of Ooty city. We visited others places like Pine forest,  golf links, Wenlock downs Kamaraj Sagar dam etc. while traveling to Pykara fall.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We reached Pykara fall at around 1 pm. For reaching fall you need to walk a bit from getting down the bus. It is really beautiful, do not miss ever when you visit Ooty. Every corner of the fall is picturesque and the water is flowing at high speed. Spending 20mins in the fall we came back to the bus and headed towards Mudumalai national park.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We had lunch near Madumalai national park. Lunch was not that great but you can have it at a reasonable price. The guide cum driver asked us Rs325 per person for jeep safari in Madumalai national park. He booked our tickets for safari. After had lunch, we started to Madumalai Park.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Both sides of the road to Madumalai park is extremely stunning You can see some deer, peacock, wild elephant on the en route to the park. As soon as we reached Madumalai we took a jeep along with 4 people. Actually, I was happy to think that I could see the tigers as the park is also a tiger reserve. Unfortunately, we had to complete the safari without the seeing tiger. Deer, wild elephants, peacocks, wild dog, Bison, and some unknown animals and birds were spotted in the forest. Yeah, that jeep safari was truly amazing. The jeep safari was for around 45mins. At the end of the safari, the driver stopped the jeep in a view. The view was also beautiful and we took some photos and returned to the bus again.
</p>

After having a great day we reached the hotel at 8 pm.
