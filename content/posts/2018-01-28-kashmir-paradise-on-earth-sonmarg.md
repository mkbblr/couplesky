I have written about <a href="http://couplesky.com/index.php/2018/01/27/kashmir-paradise-on-earth-gulmarg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gulmarg</a> and <a href="http://couplesky.com/index.php/2018/01/28/kashmir-paradise-on-earth-pahalgam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pahalgam</a> in my previous blogs. This post is my third-day trip to Sonmarg in Kashmir.

##### Sonmarg

I am not going to write how beautiful Sonmarg is! Because I have described well the beauty of Kashmir in my previous posts. Every corner of every place contains eye catchy views. So I shall give you just a hint of how to reach there and what can you do at Sonmarg at this post.

Sonmarg is 94 km away from Srinagar and it took us about 2hrs to reach there.  Sonmarg is considered as one of the must-visit places in Kashmir. Our private car charged Rs2500 for this place. The way between Srinagar and Sonmarg is awesome, you can find a meadow of forest and a water valley on both sides of the road. You can get so many &#8216;Dhabas&#8217; on the street and many of them are vegetarians. Sonmarg lies at an altitude of 2800 meters above sea level. There are several &#8216;Dhabas&#8217; at Sonmarg where you can find North Indian, South Indian and all.

**Sightseeing**

There are two main points to visit in Sonmarg one is zero point and other is the Thajiwas glacier. You have to take a pony for the glacier and a union car for the zero point. Union car charges more than Rs4000 to take to the zero point. We did not have much time to cover two places. So we choose to visit the Thajiwas glacier which is located 7km from the beautiful hill station of Sonmarg. &#8216;Ponywalas&#8217; said Rs 3500 for a pony ride for two persons. After a long bargain, they came down to Rs 1000 per person to the Thajiwas glacier. That pony ride took total two and half hour to cover the place.

An amazing ride it was! You can get to see a white mountain which is fully covered by snow. You can get a heavenly feeling. Once you reach the last spot of the glacier, the pony will take you to uphill but you need to trek down while returning back. It was a really enjoyable moment for us but it seems quite risky for old ages due to pebbles. We got a little ice at the glacier that was also of last year. Actually, the month of October is not a snowy season in Kashmir. You can get full of snow from December to April.

You can relax there and spend a good time at that point. There are two-three camps out there where you can get tea, coffee and maggie etc for refreshment. But it seems a bit higher price. You can get to enjoy a mesmerizing beauty which is surrounded by river, meadow, and mountain.

**Foods**

I have mentioned before that there are so many food points at Sonmarg. But we did not eat there.  We had our breakfast at a UP Dhaba that was on the way to Sonmarg. That was not that great but a good at a reasonable price. So we had also lunch at the same Dhaba while coming back from Sonmarg. Total cost was Rs 450 including breakfast and lunch at the Dhaba.

When you visit Kashmir, do not forget to visit Sonmarg once.
