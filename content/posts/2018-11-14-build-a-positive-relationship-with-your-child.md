  It requires quite an effort in building a good relationship between parents and  children. As kids get matured they need some kind of privacy from their parents. But the fact is that parents will always be parents who never think that their children are getting matured now. Basically, our Indian parents treat their child like a baby no matter how old the child is. Sometimes what happens is that too much love and affection may harm a relationship. And your love one starts avoiding you. Keep in mind one thing is that your child is not that little diaper baby now. You no longer have to worry about making all of their decisions.

  All parents love their children. But it does not mean that you will allow everything to do what your children want to. Even more, you can not build a good relationship with your children by that way. You should try to improve the relationship with your children rather than that. There are several tips and tricks to build a positive relationship with the child. Have a look at it:
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Make A Friendship With Your Child
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Every parent should behave like the best friend with their child. Yes, somehow it is difficult to become a best friend with children, but you should try. Actually, there are many reasons behind making a friendship with your child. In fact, you can become the best parent through becoming a best friend of your children. Becoming a best friend is a good way to know your children&#8217;s friends and develop a good habit. Moreover, it helps you to understand your children.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Listen To Your Children
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Nowadays no has time to talk to each other. Smartphone and social media kill our time. Even more, <a href="http://couplesky.com/smartphone-social-media-selfie-your-kids/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kids also prefer to stay busy with a smartphone rather than playing or talking</a>. The true fact is that we compel our children to become a smartphone baby. If we do not show an interest in listening to them how we can strengthen our relationship. So try to listen to your children as much as you can. This is the way you can come close to them.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Give Priority To Your Children
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  In the above point, I mentioned that listen to your children. But the question is how can listen to them if they do not talk to you. So as I mentioned the first point you have to make a friendship with your children. Make a friendship in such a way so that children can feel that they are really mean to you. For that parents have to show respect and interests towards children. Show your love and affection and make them feel that they are the best part of your life. When you start giving priority them your children become closer to you.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Respect Children&#8217;s Choice
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">

</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I am not saying you that love your children&#8217;s mismatched choice. Keep in mind that love and showing respect both are different. If you show your respect towards children&#8217;s choice it does not mean that you love it. But it can make a healthy relationship between you. Moreover, you can change their bad choices by being supportive.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Be There For Your Children
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Be there for your children does not mean that you just available for them physically. You have to be there emotionally as well when your children need you. You can come to close them by supporting your children mentally. You have to make your children feel that you are there for them each and every moment.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are several ways you can find to make a positive relationship between you and your children.
