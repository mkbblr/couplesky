The set of Bangles is not only a fashion jewellery, it is considered the auspicious ornaments for India married women. Wearing bangles signify her transition from a naive girl to a responsible woman. Yes, every community in the different region of India believes separate significance in wearing bangles. But truth is that wearing bangles is a part of Indian tradition and culture for a married woman unlike Sindoor, <a href="http://couplesky.com/bindi-forehead-jewellery-bindi-design-significance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bindi</a> etc. And if it is about the wedding there are different types of traditional bridal bangles from different state. Each state has its own tradition and ritual associated with bangles. So, every different bride such as Maharashtrian bride, Sikh bride, Bengali bride, Gujrati bride, Malayali bride, Marwadi bride, Rajasthani bride etc. wear their traditional bangles during the wedding. Moreover, there is a plenty of different types of bangles available which can be worn along with traditional bridal bangles at the wedding. But my bad was that I did not get the idea of such bridal set before my wedding.

I have collected different types of gorgeous bridal bangles which can be worn by every Indian bride.
