<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Choosing a life partner is not an easy thing as you think. You never can recognize a person in the first meet. There are some basic things in a person which you do not notice in even multiple times meet up. Moreover, keep in mind that never make a decision when you are in love, sad or whatever.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We think that being in a relationship with a person for a long term is everything. Actually, the concept is totally wrong. What happens in some cases is that we probably ignore some things of the person while we are dating with that person. And those unnoticed things can make your marriage life uncomfortable. So before getting married, you should know some basic things about the person. Have a look at what you must know about the person.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Important Things About A Person
</h4>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Know The Career Goal</strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The first and foremost thing is to know each other&#8217;s career goal. Nowadays career becomes one of the reasons of divorce in most of the married couple. You should know what your partner wants to. Because everyone has different dreams and both should encourage and support each other. That is the way to make a healthy relationship.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Know Each Other&#8217;s Habit</strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Although talking about each other&#8217;s habit is common before marriage, you get it all the truth out after marriage. Both of you might have a different habit and different living style. So you make sure that your partner is ready to compromise with the different habit style.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Family Planning</strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Family planning is one of the important things to know before getting married. Although most of the couples do not want even a sing child for 4/5 years after marriage, their family wants. So before getting married, you must know your partner&#8217;s opinion on it. Moreover, talk to your partner how he or she can handle this kind of situation before the family.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Past</strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We often hear past is the past. No past is not the past. Although you should not go in details about your details still you should give an idea about your past. You must provide a general roadmap of your past to the partner. And even you must know a little bit of your partner&#8217;s past. It helps you both to make a healthy and perfect relationship.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Discuss Each Other&#8217;s Worse Quality </strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I mentioned above that sometimes we do not notice some bad quality of our partner while we are in love. So you should know each other&#8217;s worse quality before getting married. If both of you are clear on that, there is no fear in your married life.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  <strong>Know Each Other&#8217;s Friends</strong>
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We never can deny that importance of our friends in our life. We have at least one best friend with who we can share each and everything whether the friend is he or she. But sometimes what happens is your partner may not take your friend easy and even you may not also. So before getting married both of you must know each other&#8217;s friends.
</p>

##### Does Your Partner Love To Travel?

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Does your partner prefer a holidaying once in a month? Sounds funny right? But it is one of the most important things to know about your partner. No matter it may not be possible to make a travel trip once in a month, but you should know your partner&#8217;s opinion on travel. Frankly, a <a href="http://couplesky.com/reasons-every-couple-travel-together/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">couple should travel together</a> to make a healthy relationship. So you should know whether your partner is interested or not on traveling.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Above all else, there are so many basic things which you should know about your partner before getting married. Simply it is necessary to know each other well to live a perfect relationship. So try to know this kind of little things before marriage.
