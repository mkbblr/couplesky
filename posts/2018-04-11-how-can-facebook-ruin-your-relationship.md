Can Facebook really ruin someone&#8217;s relationship? As we know that Facebook is a platform for connecting with new and old friends around the world. In that case, how can Facebook ruin a relationship? Actually, relationships are very fragile, it does not take much time to break. No matter how much we trust each other, but we should handle it carefully. Sometimes too much using Facebook can be a reason for destroying a relationship.

#### How Can Facebook Ruin Your Relationship

**Time:** Each relationship needs a quality time with the partner. A relationship never can be complete without spending time with each other. At the end of the busy schedule, we should share our experiences with the loved ones and that&#8217;s how a relationship can grow up. Instead of doing that if you spend the most of the times on Facebook, it will definitely hurt your partner. Facebook is such a thing where a few minutes can easily turn into several hours if you’re not careful.

**Connecting Wrong People:** Although Facebook is a platform for connecting people, sometimes connecting new people can be harmful to your relationship. There are so many people around you who live their life with own motive. You never know who&#8217;s bad or who&#8217;s good. So always be careful before accepting any friend request.  No matter how positive of a person you are, wrong people can affect you and your relationship in different ways. So, if you ever come across such kind of people, do not take time and throw away them.

**Oversharing Personal Matters:** Keep in mind that Facebook is a digital society where every people can see each other&#8217;s activity. So, do not make your personal life public. If you share everything from fighting in a little thing with your partner to overpouring love on Facebook, it can create a problem. You may not feel at that time but you never know how and when a little thing can be a cause of damage the relationship.

**Facebook Makes You Jealous:** Facebook can make you jealous. It seems awkward, but it is a fact. You may not believe it that one in four couples have fights about Facebook nearly every week. So, be careful before using Facebook.

**Become Materialistic:** People can share everything such as where they are going, what they do have from cars to home and more on social media basically on Facebook. If you put all these things in your mind and start comparing your life with them, it can create difficulty in your relationship. You may unknowingly become materialistic seeing friend&#8217;s activity for which your relationship may suffer. You cannot judge a person&#8217;s life only seeing on social media. It might be different in reality what you experience them as Facebook&#8217;s friend. So, when you notice that kind of activity, ignore it. Take a moment and be thankful for what you do have.

Above all else, there are some things that we normally ignore, but they can lead to ruin our relationship. Yeah, that is true that a married relationship is not that easy to break. But it is not fair to take anything for granted. Even more, somebody says &#8216;Too much of anything is bad&#8217;. So, too much using Facebook can be harmful to your relationship. Be careful while using social media.
