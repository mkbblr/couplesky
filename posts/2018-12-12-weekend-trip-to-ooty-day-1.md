<p style="text-align: justify;">
  So guys today I am going to write about my Ooty trip on weekend. Actually, Ooty trip was supposed to be planned on Christmas with my husband dear. But I heard that it will be a huge crowd during Christmas and new year. Moreover, we both needed a break badly from the hectic office work in some peaceful place. So we decided to go on the first weekend of December. However, it was not a long weekend, we had to take a one day leave for this <a href="http://couplesky.com/travel-story-two-days-trip-in-hampi-from-bangalore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekend trip</a>. The distance between Bangalore and Ooty is around 277 km.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Ooty Trip &#8211; Day 1
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It was an overnight journey to Ooty from Bangalore. We started our journey at 11.30pm reached Ooty by morning at 7.30 am. Our hotel Astoria Residency which was booked through <a href="https://www.goibibo.com/hotels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Goibibo</a> was 1.5 km far away from Ooty bus stand. The location of the hotel is pretty good. It takes around 20 mins to reach the hotel from the bus stand by walk and 10 mins by auto.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As we reached the hotel we had had breakfast at their own restaurant and started the day. Being traveled overnight we decided that we would visit only those places which are situated nearby our hotel on the first day. And Google map showed us which place we can visit by walk only. As per our plan, first, we headed towards by walk Ooty Botanical garden. The botanical garden is located 1km away from our stay. The entry fee of the Botanical garden for an adult is Rs30, for still camera Rs50, Rs<b>15</b> per Children and Rs<b>100</b> for Video Camera.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  As we did not have any other plan to visit that day we had spent almost one and a half hour in the Botanical garden. It was a great time there and most importantly every corner of the garden is a photo-friendly. We left the garden and started to figure out any good hotels to have lunch near the garden. But honestly, we could not find any good hotels within 200m of the garden apart from bakeries. So we had to have lunch in a small restaurant which was a bad experience.

  Ooty Shopping-First Day
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I found that shopping is quite cheaper in Ooty mainly for warm clothes. There are couples of Tibetan market near the Botanical garden. You can get any kind of warm clothes at an affordable price in the market. I bought a sweatshirt at Rs199 only. Moreover, you can find various types of soft toys in the street market at a reasonable price. After some shopping, we came back to our hotel and took rest for a while. One thing I have to say that the passion fruit is quite popular in Ooty. I saw both raw and ripe passion fruits in every fruit shop.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  At around 4 pm we went to Ooty boat house which is almost 2kms far away from the hotel. I heard that Ooty boathouse is closed at 5 pm. So we took an auto to that place for which &#8216;Autowala&#8217; charged Rs 120. I must say that It is a quite high price for 2kms. But we could not bargain with him because he gave us a price list where it was mentioned. After reaching Ooty boathouse and took entry tickets for two people prices Rs 13 per adult. There is a food court inside the campus and some small shops also. Food is decent of the food court where you get from tea, some tasty snacks to junk foods. It was a huge crowd in the Ooty lake boathouse. Spent a few times in the boathouse and came back to Auto stand. Took an auto to main bus stand who charged Rs60. We roamed around the Ooty city until darkening. I must say that the first day in Ooty was pretty good and had fun.
