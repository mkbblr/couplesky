You might be wondering on a surprise date with your husband. A date is a part of love and everyone can go on a date whether they are a married couple or unmarried. Select a romantic place and take him out and make him feel so special on Valentine&#8217;s day.

#### Surprise Him With A Lunch At His Job

Suppose he could not manage to take leave or go out with you on Valentine&#8217;s day. No matter, do not be angry with him.

Ugghh writing a letter in the digital age, no way!  Writing a letter seems outdated and no one wants to follow the tradition. But you can write a letter to your hubby dear and keep the letter anywhere else in your home he might look during a day. Sometimes an old-fashioned letter can bring two lovebirds more close to each other.

#### Give Him What He Always Wants

Sometimes your husband could hint you about something what he really wants, but he does not want to buy himself. It could be anything whether devices, watch & eyewear, sports & fitness equipment, shaving kits, musical instruments or more. If you get that thing for him on this special occasion, it will be a great gift for him. And you can buy these things at a cheaper rate from some online sites such as <a href="https://www.flipkart.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flipkart</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Amazon India</a> etc.
