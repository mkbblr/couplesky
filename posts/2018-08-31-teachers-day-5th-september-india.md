  Teachers play a great and most important role in our lives. We never can forget our teachers and their efforts in our lives. As students, we have also some responsibilities towards them. So, the teachers day is one of the best opportunities to show our gratitude to them. Teachers day is celebrated on 5th September every year in India since 1967. We all know 5th September is the birth anniversary of Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan who was a legendary teacher and India’s second President. However, some of his students and friends requested him to celebrate his birthday as ‘Radhakrishnan Day’ he declined it. He suggested to them “Instead of celebrating my birthday, it would be my proud privilege if September 5 is observed as Teachers’ Day.” Since then, 5th September has been celebrated as teachers day.

  Why Do We Celebrate Teachers Day
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  However, we celebrate the teacher&#8217;s day to honor a great child of India Dr. Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan literally we show our respect and appreciation to all the teachers. After parents, teachers are the guidance of our life path who invest their valuable time in making children&#8217;s future.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Late Dr. S. Radhakrishnan organized a gathering with some students to pay tribute to all teachers in 1965. In that gathering, he expressed his feelings regarding his birthday which should be celebrated as Teacher&#8217;s day. Since 1967, we celebrate the teacher&#8217;s day on 5th September to pay homage to our great teachers in all schools and colleges across the country.

  5th September is one of the most awaited occasions for all students of schools and colleges. Still, I can remember my childhood how we used to celebrate teachers day at our school. At that time there was no variety of personalized gifts except pen, books, and flowers. Nowadays students fill up their classroom with greeting cards, chocolates, flowers and many teachers day special personalized gifts. Moreover, students perform their talents in front of teachers. Let&#8217;s have a look at how students celebrate teacher&#8217;s day to make their teachers feel special.
