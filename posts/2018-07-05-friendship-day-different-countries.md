Friendship Day is around the world for celebrating our friendship. Many of us start preparing to celebrate the special day in a different way. The first Sunday in the month of August is one of the most awaited days among friends. However, only India and USA celebrate the Friendship Day on first Sunday of August. Other countries like Argentina, Brazil, Peru etc. celebrate the <a href="http://couplesky.com/friendship-day-history-origin/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Friendship Day</a> on different dates.

No matter how and when do we celebrate the friendship day, but the reason is the same behind celebrating the day. Friendship Day has seen an increase in popularity among friends in recent years. We do celebrate friendship day to show our love and affection towards our friendship. It is not possible to meet each and every <a href="http://couplesky.com/childhood-friend-always-special/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friend</a> every day, getting a special day to celebrate the friendship is a pretty much good idea. At least people can have fun and enjoy among their friends on the occasion of friendship day. So, let&#8217;s celebrate friendship day with a great fanfare.

As I mentioned above different countries observe the special day on different dates, have a look at when and how they celebrate the Friendship Day.

#### Friendship Day in India

We all know our country celebrate Friendship Day on the first Sunday in the month of August. On the special occasion of friendship day, we exchange our <a href="https://www.fnp.com/gifts/friendship-day#!#%3FviewIndex=2&viewSize=60&category_id=gifts%2Ffriendship-day&pageType=category&FNP_CURRENT_CATALOG_ID=india&sortFields=SEQUENCE_NUM_gifts%2Ffriendship-day%7CASC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">friendship day gifts</a> like greeting cards, flowers, friendship band etc. among our friend circle.

#### Friendship Day in the US

As I above mentioned the USA celebrate the special on the same day with India. Since some areas of Massachusetts, Ohio and sometimes in New Hampshire observe the friendship day on the 30<sup>th</sup> of June.  In Oberlin, the day is celebrated on the 8<sup>th</sup> of April every year.

#### Friendship Day in Argentina

Unlike other countries, Argentina has its own date that is the 20th of July for the friendship day. Argentina promotes the value of friendship as well as peace on the same day. However, the friend&#8217;s day is not celebrated as a public holiday in Argentina, it is not less than other festivals of the country. It has a great reason behind the celebration of the friend&#8217;s day among people. Enrique Ernesto Febbraro, an Argentine professor choose the day as the friend&#8217;s day which is inspired by Neil Armstrong&#8217;s famous line “One small step for man, a giant leap for mankind”. The line was spoken by Amstrong after landed on the moon.

#### Friendship Day in Peru

Peru celebrates the two special days like Valentine&#8217;s Day and Friendship Day on the same day that is the 14th of February. Peruvian does not believe the status of the relationship, they know one thing is that everyone should get some love. So, they celebrate the day of Love and Friendship on the same day so that everyone can feel the happiness.

#### Friendship Day in Finland

Finland also observes the friendship day on the same they as Peru that means on the 14th of February. Since 14th of February is celebrated as Valentine&#8217;s day in the world, Finland observes the day, especially for friends. Although the special day arrived quite late Finland,  it was listed as a “special” day for the first time in 1987. Actually, _**Ystävänpäivä**_ the Finnis name is for St. Valentine&#8217;s Day which means  &#8220;Friendship Day&#8221; in the Finnish Language, or &#8220;Day of the friends&#8221;. Finns celebrate Friendship Day by giving cards, flowers, candy, and jewelry to friends and relatives.

#### Friendship Day in Paraguay

Since the day of announcement of the World Friendship Day Paraguay has been celebrating the friendship day on 30th July every year. The idea of a World Friendship Day was first proposed on 20 July 1958 by Dr. Artemio Bracho during a dinner with friends in Puerto Penasco, a town on the River Paraguay. Paraguay chose the special day to promote friendship among all human beings, regardless of race, color or religion. Even more, the 20th of July has been taken as a friendship day by several countries in the world since then.

#### Friendship Day in Brazil

Brazil celebrates the Friend&#8217;s Day on 20 July every year.
