<p style="text-align: justify;">
  I can understand how a long weekend can be boring for a Bangalorean. Party lovers may say they spend time in pub or bar on a weekend. Still, a long weekend cannot be spent in the name of a party. So my husband and I plan to go somewhere near Bangalore to spend the <a href="http://couplesky.com/weekend-getaway-pondicherry-india/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">long weekend</a>. This time we went to Hampi with one more family for two days. It was really a great experience in Hampi.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Hampi From Bangalore
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Hampi is situated 350 km far away from Bangalore. It takes almost 6-7 hours to reach Hampi from Bangalore. You can travel to Hampi by bus, by tr, in and by car as well. Since we were two families so we decided to travel in our own car. According to our plan, we have started early morning around 4 am from Bangalore. And we reached Hampi around 11 am.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  We followed the route Bangalore to Tumakuru, Tumkur to Chitradurga, Chitradurga to Hosapete/ Hospet and Hospet to Hampi. You can find a couple of Dhabas and roadside hotels on the way to Chitradurga. But after crossing the Chitradurga do not expect Dhaba or restaurant facilities. Moreover, Google Map will show you some shortcut routes which are not in good condition. You can hardly find other vehicles to except a lot of trucks on the way. So if you want to go to Hampi make a plan at a daytime.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Sight-Seeing Of Hampi
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Hampi is an ancient village located on the banks of the Tungabhadra River in the eastern part of central Karnataka. It was a capital of the Vijayanagar Empire during 14th to the 16th century AD. UNESCO has declared Hampi as a world heritage site for its ruins. It is a historical as well as a religious place in India. These ruins are divided into two main areas: the Sacred Centre, around Hampi Bazaar; and the Royal Centre, towards Kamalapuram – which are the two main points of entry to the ruins.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  The amazing thing is that every rock says a story. If you are really interested in history and nature you will definitely love the place. There are several places to visit in Hampi which can tell you many things about the Vijayanagar Empire. You can hire a guide for the Hampi trip but I suggest you should visit yourself by walking or cycling.
</p>

<h4 style="text-align: justify;">
  Must Visit Places In Hampi
</h4>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are so many places to visit in Hampi. If you have time try to cover all the places. Because every place has their own story along with special architecture. I have mentioned some attractions in Hampi.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Virupaksha Temple
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Virupaksha Temple is situated on the south bank of the river Tungabhadra. This temple is one of the famous attractions and pilgrimage in Hampi.<a href="http://www.mysteryofindia.com/2014/11/ancient-virupaksha-temple-hampi.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Virupaksha temple</a> is dedicated to Lord Shiva. The temple is also known as Pampapati Temple and it is constructed in Dravidian architecture style.

  Vittala Temple
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Vijaya Vittala temple is one of the ancient monuments in Hampi which is famous for exceptional architecture and unmatched craftsmanship. The <a href="https://www.karnataka.com/hampi/vittala-temple/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vittala Temple</a> is also known as Shri Vijaya Vitthala Temple and the temple is dedicated to Lord Vitthala, an incarnation of Lord Vishnu. One of the amazing things of this temple is that it has 56 musical pillars. These musical pillars are named with SAREGAMA pillars. These musical pillars emit music differently when they are tapped.

  Octagonal Bath
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  It is a giant bathing area almost 2.4 m (7.8 ft) deep which is constructed with an octagonal shape. Octagonal Bath is located in near Hazara Rama temple. It is one of the best attractions in Hampi by which you can guess how the residents and their guests socialized while performing important cleansing rituals.

  Elephant Stable
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Elephant stable is one of the major attractions in Hampi. Never miss this place when you visit Hampi. You can find Lotus temple, Zanana enclosure monuments at the same compound of elephant stable. These places are located near Ranga temple and it covers a huge complex. You just need to get a ticket to explore the place.

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  Above all else, there are so many attractions in Hampi which you cannot finish in 2 days. Minimum you need 4/5 days to finish them. But I must say that we had a great time in Hampi.
</p>

<h5 style="text-align: justify;">
  Hotels in Hampi
</h5>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  There are so many hotels, home stays, and cottage available in Hampi, But we stayed in Hyatt which is located in Hospet 30 km distance of Hampi. We had breakfast in Hyatt which was complimentary buffet breakfast and has lunch in Mang Tree. It was really awesome food in both.
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
  If it is about budget we spent Rs12k in Hampi for two days. To be honest the place is not that costly but we had to spend more on staying which was around Rs 4000 per night. You can make a budget friendly trip to Hampi easily.
